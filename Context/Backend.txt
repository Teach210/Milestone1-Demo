BACKEND DEPLOYMENT - COMPLETED

Deployed URL: https://milestone2-demo.onrender.com
Hosting: Render
Database: MySQL (remote connection via env vars)
Email Service: SendGrid REST API (switched from SMTP due to port blocking)

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES SET ON RENDER:
- BACKEND_URL=https://milestone2-demo.onrender.com
- FRONTEND_URL=http://localhost:5173 (needs update after frontend deployment)
- DB_HOST, DB_USER, DB_PASSWORD, DB_DATABASE (MySQL connection)
- SMTP_EMAIL=siam.sadid@gmail.com
- SMTP_PASSWORD=<SendGrid API key>
- SENDGRID_API_KEY (optional, uses SMTP_PASSWORD if not set)
- RECAPTCHA_SECRET_KEY=6LdsdR4sAAAAAJVPJAGr781ZGAHQ10R_DC1Pd2II

KEY BACKEND CHANGES:
1. Replaced all hardcoded localhost URLs with environment variables (BACKEND_URL, FRONTEND_URL)
2. Switched from nodemailer SMTP to @sendgrid/mail REST API to avoid Render port blocking
3. Added try-catch around email sending in registration so SMTP failures don't block responses
4. CORS currently allows only http://localhost:5173 - must update after frontend deployment

ALL ENDPOINTS TESTED & WORKING:
User: /user/register, /user/login, /user/verify, /user/verify-2fa, /user/resend-2fa, 
      /user/:id (GET/PUT/DELETE), /user/profile/:id, /user/forgot-password, 
      /user/reset-password, /user/change-password/:id
Advising: /advising (POST), /advising/history/:userId, /advising/:id (GET/PUT), 
          /advising/debug/tables, /advising/debug/rows
Health: /test

FRONTEND REQUIREMENTS:
1. Update all API calls from http://localhost:4040 to https://milestone2-demo.onrender.com
2. After deploying frontend, update BACKEND_URL CORS and FRONTEND_URL env var on Render
3. Ensure frontend handles 2FA flow (login returns userId, then verify-2fa with code from email)
4. Email verification and password reset links now point to correct deployed URLs
5. All email/password flows require SendGrid email delivery (users receive actual emails)

NEXT STEPS:
- Deploy frontend to Firebase Hosting
- Update FRONTEND_URL env var on Render with deployed frontend URL
- Update CORS in server/app.js to allow deployed frontend origin
- Test frontend → backend integration end-to-end
